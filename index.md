The goal of the AI Summer camp for High School students is to introduce the students to AI with the help of lectures, tutorials, and most importantly hands-on activities. The objective is to actively engage and inspire the students. Students are not required to know coding/programming in advance. But they do need to bring enthusiasm and curiosity!

For AIISC, organizing this camp is a major activity to fulfill its mission of broadening participation in computing (BPC), DEI, and workforce development. The 2024 Summer AI camp is specially organized for the students of the Richland County School District Two (Richland Two). It is a nationally recognized school district located in suburban Columbia, South Carolina, United States, in the northeast section of Richland County. It is one of the fastest-growing districts in South Carolina. It serves 28,296 students this year. Students at these schools are very diverse and have a high Pupil in Poverty (PIP) status. The PIP represents the proportion of students living in poverty. The total number of pupils in poverty (PIP), indicating financial need, is over 55%
