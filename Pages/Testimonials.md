“The intro to python and the ai in gaming were very enjoyable as they were very interactive and I was consistently doing something. The grad students walking around and helping was very useful.”

“All of the chatGPT activities were fun. It is easier to be engaged when we are doing something hands on. having something that seems like our own (tic tac toe) was very validating and enjoyable.”

“I liked how the machine learning examples used both vocal explanation through the physical lecture and visual representation through informative videos provided adjacent to what was being said.”

“All of today was very engaging and interesting. I enjoyed getting to see something in real life then later having it explained and broken down. I also found the conent and detection very enjoyable it really made me think about ethical and moral issues that have to be addressed in order to address these issues.”

“I like the fact that we were able to discuss the downsides of AI-generated information. It gives us the awareness that AI-generated information could potentially have negative impacts. Thus, why there are debates and research on what we could do to fix problems regarding AI-generated text detection.”
