The AI Summer Camp will be held on the <b>week of June 3rd</b> at the AI Institute of South Carolina (AIISC) on the USC campus ([AIISC on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/AI+Institute,+University+of+South+Carolina/@33.9948091,-81.0315395,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f8bb336cf288a3:0x20e0315b3133bf1d!8m2!3d33.9948091!4d-81.0315395!16s%2Fg%2F11ll3q_49j?entry=ttu)).

The camp will have eighteen sessions of around 1hr 15mins each (Monday-Thursday: 9am to 3pm; Friday: 9am to noon). These sessions are planned with a view of high engagement, through a combination of short lectures with a lot of visuals, demos, and short videos, and most importantly, hands-on activities. The camp participants are not required to have prior coding experience but are required to bring a laptop. Organizing this camp requires a very large commitment from the AIISC, which involves Prof. Amit Sheth and a few of his graduate students throughout the week.
